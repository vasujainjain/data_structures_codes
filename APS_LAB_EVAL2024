QUESTION

Given an array A[] of N integers where each value represents the number of chocolates in a packet. Each 
packet will have a variable number of chocolates. There are m students, the task is to distribute chocolate 
packets such that each student gets one packet and the difference between the number of chocolates in 
the packet with maximum chocolates and the packet with minimum chocolates given to the students is 
minimum.
Example 1: A[ ] = {12, 4, 7, 9, 2, 23, 25, 41, 27}, and m = 3
Output: Minimum difference is 4. (as we select packets with 23, 25 and 27)
Example 2: A = {12, 4, 7, 9, 2, 23, 25, 41, 27}, and number of students = 4
Output: Minimum difference is 7. (as we select packets with 2, 4, 7 and 9)

SOLUTION

int distribute_minimum(int arr[],int n,int m)
{
    sort(arr,arr+n);
    int min=arr[m-1]-arr[0];
for(int i=0;i<(n-m+1);i++)
{
   if(arr[i+m-1]-arr[i]<min)
   {
   min=arr[i-1+m]-arr[i];
   }
}
return min;
}
int main()
{
    int arr[]={2,4,7,9,12,23,25,27,41};
    int m=distribute_minimum(arr,9,5);
    cout<<"minimum difference is "<<m;
    return 0;
}
